# Speed typing application

A speed typing application written in python to help you improve your typing abilities. The app shows a passage of text to the user and the user attempts to type out what is one the screen, as they type letters typed out correctly are shown in white while those that are incorrect are shown in red. At the end the app calculates the user's wpm and accuracy based off of data accumulated throughout the test. The app then displays this information to the user. 

## Why
I am currently trying to imrpove my own typing skills and this project was a good way for me to make a tool custom to my needs while also improving my coding abilities. The app is fairly simple but some improvements are in the pipeline.

## Libraies and modules used

The makes use of `pygame` for graphics related tasks, and `SQLalchemy` to talk to a local database. Everything else is built from scratch. Both of these modules can be installed using the resective `pip install` commands.
